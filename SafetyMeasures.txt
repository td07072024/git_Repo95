The 'Uttar Pradesh Fire and Emergency Services Department'[35] has introduced four advanced Articulating Water Towers (AWTs) to enhance fire safety at the Maha Kumbh Mela 2025. These high-tech towers are specifically designed to handle fire incidents in multi-storey structures and large tents, ensuring quick and effective response.

Each AWT is equipped with video and thermal imaging cameras, allowing real-time monitoring and precise firefighting. These towers can operate up to 35 meters in height and extend 30 meters horizontally, providing a protective shield for firefighters during high-risk operations.

To further strengthen fire safety, the government has allocated â‚¹131.48 crore for:[3]

351 firefighting vehicles
50+ fire stations
20 fire posts
2,000+ trained personnel
Fire safety equipment for every tent
Lost and Found Centers
The Prayagraj Mela Committee has set up 10 'Khoya-Paya Kendra' across different sectors to help reunite missing individuals with their families. These high-tech centers will use digital registration to keep track of lost persons, making the process faster and more efficient.

Key details about missing individuals will be displayed at all centers, and regular announcements will be made to assist in reunions. Additionally, social media platforms will be leveraged to spread information and help reconnect lost individuals with their loved ones.[36]

Security Personnel
To ensure safety throughout the event, over 45,000 police personnel will be deployed, supported by 55+ police stations. Additionally, forces from the Uttar Pradesh Provincial Armed Constabulary (UP-PAC), National Disaster Response Force, and Central Armed Police Forces will assist in maintaining security.[citation needed]
