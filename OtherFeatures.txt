Environmental Sustainability
Green Maha Kumbh will be held on 31 January 2025, bringing together over 1,000 environmental and water conservation experts. Organized as part of the 'Gyan Maha Kumbh - 2081' series organized by Shiksha Sanskriti Utthan Nyas.[27]

Incidents
On 19 January 2025, a fire caused by an exploding gas cylinder destroyed at least 18 temporary tents at the festival grounds. No injuries were reported.[28]

On 29 January 2025, a stampede at the festival grounds left 30 people dead and 60 others injured.[29]

Infrastructure
The authorities have set up a temporary city covering 4,000 hectares (40 km2) to accommodate the massive number of pilgrims attending the Maha Kumbh Mela 2025. This city includes 150,000 tents, improved sanitation facilities, and better transportation services. To ensure security, 40,000 police officers and AI-powered surveillance systems have been deployed.

To expand the available land, four dredging machines were used to reclaim 26 additional hectares (0.26 km2), significantly increasing the Sangam’s capacity—three times more than in 2019 Prayag Ardh Kumbh Mela.

The area has been divided into 25 sectors. The total length of the ghats is 12 km (7.5 mi). Parking facilities now cover 1,850 hectares (18.5 km2). The total road length within the Mela area has increased over 450 km (280 mi) to improve accessibility.[3]

Railway Infrastructure
Indian Railways has announced an increase in the number of coaches in key trains, such as the Prayagraj Express and Lucknow Mail, to accommodate the expected influx of pilgrims during the Mahakumbh 2025.[30]

Indian Railways operated their all-time high of 360 trains to Prayagraj railway stations including 190 special trains, 110 regular trains and 60 MEMU trains to manage the pilgrims who came to take a holy dip on the day of Mauni Amavasya, on 29 January 2025.[31][32]

Sanitation Facilities
The Maha Kumbh 2025 Mela will have established cleaning standards with one sweeper for every 10 toilets and one supervisor monitoring a batch of 10 sweepers.[33] The Prayagraj Mela Authority has engaged nearly 10,000 sanitation workers to ensure a clean Maha Kumbh.

Under the 'Swachh Kumbh initiative', the Prayagraj Mela Committee has set up around 150,000 toilets and urinals in the Maha Kumbh area. Apart from the installation of 150,000 toilets and urinals, a 'QR code-based' monitoring system is being launched to track sanitation levels in toilets.
