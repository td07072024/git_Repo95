Since the Kumbh Mela has been organized for ages and its commencement date is unknown, calculating the exact 144-year cycle is not certain. However, as per astronomical calculations, the 2025 Mahakumbh Mela is unique in itself since its constellation alignment is witnessed once every 144 years. Thus, the most auspicious of all the Maha Kumbh in the past 144 years is in 2025.[2][3][4][5]

The site of each Kumbh Mela is decided by the astrological alignment of Jupiter (Guru), Sun (Surya), and Moon (Chandra).
